# mongoose-model-to-golang-struct
A template code to convert mongoose JSON Object into a struct . 

You dont need to install any package . Just run it via Nodejs . 
This is just MVP . Top level variable can be replaced with the json object you want to Golang Struct . 


Helpful for those who are migrating from node to golang and using mongoose as a wrapper for mongodb . 

It will give you a struct , and another output for the keys that were not converted .





Cli / File Support / UI release may or maynot come .
